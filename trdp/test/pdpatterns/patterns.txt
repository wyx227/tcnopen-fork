Process data tests
------------------------------------------------------------

PD tests verify exchange of process data between two devices A and B. All defined PD patterns are tested.
Test cases and their parameters are summarized in table bellow. 
All the test cases are run in parallel during the test session.

The exact period depends on the high performance index table base.
Standard with HIGH_PERF_INDEXED=1 is base 10: 1, 10, 100ms.
With additional HIGH_PERF_BASE2=1 the index is switched to base 2: 1, 8, 64ms.

All the test cases are run on two target plattforms - Linux and Windows. 
TCNOpen implementation of TRDP stack is also tested against TRDP implementation developed by UniControls.
Following table sumarizes the tests performed on the two plattforms and implementations:

Device A           Device B
------------------------------------
Windows/TCNOpen    Linux/TCNOpen
Linux/TCNOpen      Windows/TCNOpen
Windows/TCNOpen    Windows/TCNOpen
Windows/UC         Linux/TCNOpen
