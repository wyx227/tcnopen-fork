#// Remarks
#//   CWE 2023-03-27: Commitment: TSN will be used by selecting a VLAN-Ethenet-interface over a certain IP-address (VLAN-tag is added by the OS, TSN is matched over VLAN PCP egress/ingress IP-QoS). Etherner/IP/UDP+TCP will be handled by the OS: no RAW socket necessary
#//   CWE 2022-12-21: UUID needed to compile and link TSN
